To Run:

Make sure you have setup, the graphics.h library in your laptop.

To install Graphics.h on windows in case you don't have it, you can refer to the following Link :

Graphics.h library works on a Windows Pc and not on Mac, so in case of a Mac this project won't work. You could try something similar on OpenGL which works on both windows and Mac however the code for that is different.
