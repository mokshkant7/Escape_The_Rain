# Escape_The_Rain

In this interactive C++ program a man tries to escape the Rain by running into his house so that he can relax and listen to some music. Colour is also there inside some objects. You can use keys to perform various tasks.


To Run:

Make sure you have setup, the graphics.h library in your laptop.

To install Graphics.h on windows in case you don't have it, you can refer to the following Link :

Graphics.h library works on a Windows Pc and not on Mac, so in case of a Mac this project won't work. You could try something similar on OpenGL which works on both windows and Mac however the code for that is different.
